Contact
=======
A simple, private chat system. 

* Chat one-to-one or many-to-many
* You control the data, end to end. No data is snooped or stored.
* For many-to-many chat, host your own private [relay](https://github.com/75lb/contact-server) locally or for free on Heroku
* Terminal and web clients
* Simple, pluggable architecture. Messages stream through the client, making it trivial to insert new commands / views etc. into the pipeline.
